It is just a first draft, many things to be done
There are two folders named inlude and lib under the project home, they contain dependencies headers and libs.
For examples:
CMahout/include/cppuint
CNahout/lib/libcppunit.so

I did not commit the to the github repo for there is just lmimit space for free.
